# Problem Introduction
In this problem, you will design and implement an elementary greedy algorithm
used by cashiers all over the world millions of times per day.

# Task
The goal in this problem is to find the minimum number of coins needed to change the input value
(an integer) into coins with denominations 1, 5, and 10.

# Input Format
The input consists of a single integer 𝑚.

# Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 103.

# Output Format
Output the minimum number of coins with denominations 1, 5, 10 that changes 𝑚.
