# Problem Introduction
Majority rule is a decision rule that selects the alternative which has a majority,
that is, more than half the votes.
Given a sequence of elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, you would like to check whether
it contains an element that appears more than 𝑛/2 times.

# Task
The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element.

# Input Format
The first line contains an integer 𝑛, the next one contains a sequence of 𝑛 non-negative
integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.

# Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105; 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.

# Output Format
Output 1 if the sequence contains an element that appears strictly more than 𝑛/2 times,
and 0 otherwise.
