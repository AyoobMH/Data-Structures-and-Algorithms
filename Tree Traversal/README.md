# Binary Tree
An alogorithm that will traverse the tree in a specific method (in order, pre order, post order).

# NOTE: The following algorithm works only on a specific input format......See below

# Problem Description

# Task
You are given a rooted binary tree. Build and output its in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals.

# Input Format. The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The vertices of the tree are numbered
from 0 to 𝑛 − 1. Vertex 0 is the root.
The next 𝑛 lines contain information about vertices 0, 1, ..., 𝑛−1 in order. Each of these lines contains
three integers 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 — 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 is the key of the 𝑖-th vertex, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 is the index of the left
child of the 𝑖-th vertex, and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 is the index of the right child of the 𝑖-th vertex. If 𝑖 doesn’t have
left or right child (or both), the corresponding 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 or 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 (or both) will be equal to −1.

# Constraints
1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105; 0 ≤ 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 ≤ 109; −1 ≤ 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖, 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1. It is guaranteed that the input
represents a valid binary tree. In particular, if 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1, then 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖. Also,
a vertex cannot be a child of two different vertices. Also, each vertex is a descendant of the root vertex.

# Output Format
Print three lines. The first line should contain the keys of the vertices in the in-order
traversal of the tree. The second line should contain the keys of the vertices in the pre-order traversal
of the tree. The third line should contain the keys of the vertices in the post-order traversal of the tree.
